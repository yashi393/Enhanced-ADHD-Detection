# Enhanced-ADHD-Detection
AI-driven diagnostic model using deep learning, NLP, and behavioral data to improve early detection of ADHD, enabling more precise and timely intervention.

Timely and accurate identification of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is crucial for effective intervention, given its impact on cognitive functions, attention span, and impulse control. Machine learning algorithms present an opportunity to refine ADHD detection by analyzing diverse datasets containing biological, psychological, and behavioral markers associated with the disorder. Techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks offer unique advantages in handling complex data patterns and can aid clinicians in making more informed diagnostic decisions. By integrating machine learning into the diagnostic process, we aim to enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of ADHD assessments, ultimately leading to better-tailored interventions and improved outcomes for individuals with ADHD. However, ethical considerations, including data privacy and algorithmic transparency, must be carefully addressed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of machine learning-driven diagnostic systems in healthcare settings.
